# URL Classification model using Machine Learning
### For Computer Science B.Sc. Ariel University

**By Yuval Yurzdichinsky, Matan Aviv and Roy Simanovich**

## Introduction
In this project we will build a machine learning model that will classify URLs based on if they are malicious (phishing, malware, etc.) or benign. We will use a dataset of URLs that are labeled as either malicious or benign and use it to train a model that will be able to classify new URLs.
